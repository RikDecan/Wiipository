      "summary": "Broken Sword, the renowned series by Charles Cecil, makes its way to the Nintendo Wii, and old fans and new players alike won't be disappointed in this \"Director's Cut\" version. The classic adventure game series is brought up to date with a new narrative loosely based on the original and with game play mechanics that take advantage of the unique aspects of the Nintendo Wii.\n\nThe original Broken Sword was praised for its engaging story line that kept players guessing what would happen next. This version closely follows the original story but adds an interwoven narrative that serves as a prequel to future games.\n\nSpecifically, the game explores the history of the female protagonist Nico, and how her mysterious past connects with the events that are unfolding in the story. All this new material is seamlessly added to the original.\n\nClassic, Puzzle-Driven game play with Wii-Specific Controls\nLike the original, Broken Sword features puzzles and brain-teasers that are woven into the narrative of the game. Players have to come up with solutions to problems that are encountered during the game in order to move forward with game play. Broken Sword takes advantage of the Wii's motion controls to introduce new, interesting puzzles. In order to solve some puzzles, for example, you'll have to use the Wii remote to turn dials and push blocks.\n\nNew Graphics and Animations\nThe detailed graphics and animation are drawn by Dave Gibbons, the artist behind the graphic novel and movie \"Watchmen.\" The game features a style that makes it look like an animated movie, and this version adds a new first-person perspective when interacting with objects and people in order to increase the sense of immersion.\n\nBeautiful Music and Soundtrack by Barrington Pheloung\nFamed composer Barrington Pheloung composed the original score for Broken Sword and has expanded it for this Director's Cut. The original voice cast has also returned to add new parts for the newly expanded version of the game. All of this adds up to a rich experience.\n\nExclusive Two-Player Mode for the Wii\nInstead of going at it alone, you can add a second player to the fray in the Wii version. Two cursors show up on the screen, and one player becomes the main player while the second highlights areas of interest on the screen. Working co-operatively adds another dimension to the game and allows the game to be enjoyed simultaneously by two players. \n\nBroken Sword: Shadow of the Templars:The Director's Cut builds on the original, boasting a new and explosive narrative interwoven with the first story. This game brings the adventure genre to life like never before with unique DS and Wii controls. After witnessing the brutal and horrifying murder of one of Paris¿s richest and most influential statesmen, the player is pulled into a sinister conspiracy rooted in a long- forgotten medieval legend.",

The new game uses both the famed dance mat controller and the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers, with players matching the on-screen arrows with the corresponding footwork, and also using their arms to meet additional moving goals.\n\nThis total movement is spotlighted perfectly in DanceDanceRevolution: Hottest Party 4's stunning Choreograph mode. This new idea is perfectly designed to appeal to both DDR novices and hardened dancers alike, and adds new depth to the classic gameplay. Furthermore, owners of Nintendo's Wii Balance Board can use it instead of a dance mat, with the board registering complete body movement.\n\nDanceDanceRevolution: Hottest Party 4 allows up to four players to get together and compete against each other, and can be bought with a dance mat controller or a solus title, and enjoys a stunning collection of suitably high-tempo tracks. The new game offers 20 licensed tunes, including Lady Gaga's classic 'Bad Romance', Paramore's 'CrushCrushCrush' and the classic 'Celebration' from Kool and the Gang. There are also more than 30 specially-created tunes from Konami's in-house team, all of which are designed to test the player's co-ordination and rhythm.\n\nWith a wealth of game modes - including the eternally popular Calorie Counter system so users can watch the pounds drop off as they dance! - DanceDanceRevolution: Hottest Party 4 is a stunning party game that absolutely anyone can enjoy.",

In pursuit of a juicy lead, he makes his way to the small suburban town of Willamette only to find that it has become overrun by zombies. Frank escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be a bastion of safety but it turns out to be anything but. It will be a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but players will have full reign of a realistic shopping centre and its varied stores offering an endless supply of real and makeshift weapons to fight off the flesh-hungry mob. If Frank is running low on health he can pay a visit to one of the many restaurants or cafes for a meal in order to restore his energy and continue the fight. The game is split into a series of individual cases, all of which Frank must complete in order to gain vital information that will allow him to piece together the truth behind the horrendous epidemic. In addition to the cases, players will be faced with the dilemma of deciding the rescue priority of the residents of Wilamette who also sought sanctuary in the mall. Depending on the player's skill, some may not be so fortunate as each rescue needs to be undertaken in a set time period, therefore players may need to delay completion of a case in order to save a fellow human. Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop's infectious humor delivers some welcome relief from the incessant tide of zombies with players able to dress Frank up in a variety of comedic costumes and take on the undead hordes with a selection of improvised and sometimes highly ineffective weapons such as a toy sword or a football.",

In an act of desperation, the high wizard Zale sundered the land and created a rift around Celenheim, keeping the armies of Vatar at bay. In time, Celenheim forgot the war and forgot Vatar as they went about their daily affairs. Now, the rift is closing, and evil threatens the land once again. An unlikely hero, freed from prison by happenstance, must rise and fight for Light or Darkness, to either destroy the demon king Vatar or kill the queen of Celenheim.\n\nThe end seemed inescapable... Vatar - the Prince of Darkness had won. But a lonely Mage stands high up on a mountain ridge, defying the Demon. He lifts his staff high in the air then thumps it down on the earth – and unimaginably powerful spells are created, harnessing the infernal powers of nature. The rift caused by the Mage's powerful spell continues to expand, sucking everything into a seemingly endless abyss.\n\nOn the one side an Enclave of Light was created, which they called Celenheim. On the other side of the gigantic ravine, dark and evil life forms were fighting to survive in the Outlands.However, the centuries passed and now the ravine has become narrower. Attacks from the shadow world have grown in number and intensity. In these difficult times, vital decisions must be made, and it's all up to the player!",

Intuitive controls and the game’s encouraging “explore at your own pace” approach create a momentary retreat.\n\nThe beauty of Endless Ocean is that players can do as much or as little as they like. The relaxed and calm atmosphere of the game gives divers the freedom to explore special locations such as shipwrecks and underwater ruins, discover and interact with sea-life, complete fish logs or simply relax in the soothing environment.\n\nFor players really looking to kick back and relax Endless Ocean features several soothing modes. On the deck of the boat is a deckchair that allows the player to sit and watch the sea. Alternatively in the aquarium section of the game players can select fish they have seen and add them in an aquarium for a closer inspection. What's more this game even doubles up as a tranquil screensaver if the Wii Remote is left untouched. The relaxed setting is further heightened with a tranquil soundtrack from New Zealand songstress Hayley Westenra.\n\nIf players prefer to dive with a buddy, the Wii's unique WiFi Connection Service allows players link up with their friends. By exchanging friend codes, two players may dive and explore the ocean together. In this co-op mode they have access to all the tools that can be used in single player mode, as well as an additional mode of communication controlled with the D-pad. With a fish logbook to complete, items to be salvaged and collected and the ability to listen to your own MP3's via the Wii SD Card slot while you dive, Endless Ocean provides hours of entertainment.",

The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.\n\nFIFA 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.",

Players have the ability to analyze space, work harder and smarter to break down the defense, and think two plays ahead. Now every touch matters with the most comprehensive and intuitive dribbling system ever developed for the franchise. Inspired by the world's best player, Lionel Messi, Complete Dribbling enables players to face their opponent and use precise dribble touches combined with true 360° mobility with the ball, so it's easier to be more creative and dangerous in 1v1 opportunities. FIFA Soccer 13 1st Touch Control transforms the way players control the ball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player on the pitch, and creating more opportunities for defenders to win back possession. The second generation of the Player Impact Engine expands physical play from just collisions to off-the-ball battles between players. Defenders can push and pull for position, and utilize their size and strength to force opponents into poor touches and decisions before the ball arrives. FIFA Soccer 13 Tactical Free Kicks provides the tools to create dangerous and unpredictable free kicks. Position up to three players over the ball and utilize dummy runs and more passing options to outwit your opponent.\n\n• Attacking Intelligence- All-new positioning intelligence infuses attacking players with the ability to analyze plays, and to better position themselves to create new attacking opportunities. Players will work harder and smarter to break down defenses, make runs that pull defenders out of position, and open passing channels for teammates. Plus, players possess an off-the-ball vision and the ability to think two plays ahead to create, curve, or alter runs to capitalize on openings as they occur.\n\n• Complete Dribbling- Make every touch matter with complete control of the ball. Take on defenders with the freedom to be more creative in attack. Players are more explosive accelerating with the ball, and utilize precise dribble touches with true 360° mobility with the ball while facing a defender. Face an opponent to threaten attack while moving with the ball in any direction to dodge tackles, or turn and shield the ball, maintaining position, and holding off defenders for longer stretches.\n\n• FIFA 13 1st Touch Control- A new system eliminates near-perfect control for every player by creating uncertainty when receiving difficult balls. Poor passes are harder to control, enabling defenders to capitalize on errant balls and poor touches. Multiple factors such as defensive pressure, trajectory of the ball, and velocity of the pass all factor into a player's success. Players with better control and skill stand out. Fewer perfect touches, the potential to over hit passes, more opportunity for loose balls, and greater balance between defending and attacking.\n\n• Player Impact Engine-The second generation of the award-winning physics engine expands physical play from just collisions to off-the-ball battles, giving defenders more tools to win back possession. Defenders can use their body to win possession, push and pull for position, and utilize their size and strength to force opponents into poor touches and decisions before the ball arrives.\n\n• FIFA 13 Tactical Free Kicks-Create dangerous and unpredictable free kicks. Position up to three attacking players over the ball and confuse opponents with dummy runs, more passing options, and more elaborate free kicks. Opponents can counter by adding or subtracting players to the wall, creeping the wall forward, or sending a bullet man to intercept the pass or block the shot.\n\n• New Passes-Two new passing options give players the ability to finesse passes over the outstretched leg of a defender or play lower trajectory lofted through balls into space or to teammates.\n\n• FIFA 13 Fundamentals-Essential elements have been refined to make the experience more authentic.

Players have four times the decision making ability and feel alive with human-like reactions, anticipation, and instincts. With 10 times more animation depth and detail than previous consoles, FIFA 14 delivers the dynamic movements and biomechanics of the world’s best footballers.\n\nPlayers are agile and athletic as they plant, pivot and cut, and explode out of each step. The increased fidelity has a game-changing effect on gameplay. Plus, the artistry and athleticism of footballers will come to life with the addition of hundreds of new types of skills and hundreds of new behaviors. And for the first time ever, fans will feel the electricity of a living stadium as the emotions of new 3D crowds rise and fall around the stories on the pitch. Additional features will be revealed in the months ahead.\n\nKey Features\n\nEA SPORTS IGNITE—Ignite blends new technology with the best rendering, run-time physics, animation, intelligence, locomotion, and online systems from across EA into one powerful, new engine. Athletes possess human-like intelligence for advanced decision-making, players have true athletic motion, and living worlds make the game experience as rich and dynamic as real-world stadiums.\nPro Instincts— Players will make intelligent decisions with human-like reaction times, moving instinctively around the pitch like world class footballers. Players will anticipate moves to seal off opponents and intercept passes, skip over tackles and out-stretched legs to avoid collisions, and slow opponents by hooking or holding an arm.\nPrecision Movement— With 10 times more animation depth and detail, EA SPORTS IGNITE delivers the dynamic movements and biomechanics of the world’s best footballers. Every step counts as players now plant, pivot and cut, change direction and shift their momentum with the agility and explosiveness of elite athletes. Player acceleration and deceleration is more realistic with a game-changing effect on gameplay. Players feel more grounded, agile and explosive, and manage their momentum with distinct foot plants and push-offs.\nElite Technique— Harnessing the power and memory of the new consoles, FIFA 14 delivers hundreds of never-before-seen new skills and behaviors. Players have an arsenal of new shot types such as side volleys, defections, power chips and first time screamers, and new passes such as touch, over-head, slice and lobs. New behaviors include trapping the ball in stride at pace, panic turns when defenders are beaten, off-balance shots, missed shot reactions, and more.\nLiving Worlds— The world inside the stadium feels alive and stunning 3D crowds and dynamic sidelines impact the experience. Players are also aware of the match and what needs to be done to get a result—their sense of urgency increases as the match draws on, and if a goal is needed, they rush to take a throw-in or corner if time is running down.\nPure Shot—Players have the intelligence to adjust their stride and approach angle to find the best position for hitting the back of the net. Well-hit balls feel satisfying and goals are rewarding. As well as quality strikes, players can now shoot while off balance or rushed.\nReal Ball Physics— Strike the ball with more force and finesse. Realistic ball physics now determines the trajectories of balls in game, enabling players to strike the ball with force from distance, drill low rising shots with accuracy, and blast dipping or swerving shots, just like real footballers.\nProtect The Ball— Dominate midfield and dictate the tempo. Fend-off and block defenders from the ball while dribbling at any speed. Protect the ball from opponents to control play through midfield and dictate the pace of the match. Plus, out-muscle opponents for position before receiving the ball, then turn defenders to carve out opportunities.\nTeammate Intelligence— Better decision-making delivers tighter, smarter marking and improved run tracking. Defenders recognize opportunities to provide support and win back possession. Attacking players have new ways to outsmart their opponents by creating space for themselves, running along the backline and checking their pace.\nSprint Dribble Turns— Utilize quick, explosive cuts and turns to beat defenders one-on-one while sprinting with the ball. Players can move in any direction, preserving their natural momentum and maintaining possession of the ball.\nVariable Dribble Touches— The First Touch Control of dribbling varies a player’s touch when dribbling with pace. Skilled players stand out while less skilled players will experience fewer perfect touches and more uncertainty dribbling.\nSkill Games–A competitive practice mode to learn or master the fundamental skills necessary to compete at FIFA 14. Become a better player, faster, no matter what your skill level, competing against yourself or friends in all-new mini-games.\nCareer Mode— Search for talent year-round with the new Global Transfer Network that brings the world of professional scouting to life. Develop and refine your own scouting network. Evaluate footballers to uncover the attributes of players who could bolster your squad during the transfer windows. A new hub delivers easy navigation, fewer interruptions and live scouting reports.\nComplete Authenticity—500 officially licensed clubs, over 30 leagues and more than 15,000 players.",

You don't have to perform the moves exactly, but dancing along is a bit easier than swinging your arms when the arrows appear, because it's all about timing. Even if you're making some outrageous gestures, as long as you are more or less following along, you'll do just fine. Your score is tallied at the end to see how well you shook your bon bon--wait, that's not it. If you're too embarrassed to do this on your own, bring a friend along and see who's the better dancer in Versus mode.\n\nBy going through the game's Challenge mode, which tracks and ranks your progression, you can eventually unlock the ability to import your Mii and dress him or her up in a variety of trendy clothing. You earn Kidz Bop points when you play, which can be spent shopping for a sleek new outfit. There are a good number of shoes, outfits, and hairstyles to choose from so that you can be whoever you want to be. At the end of a song, not only are you rated based on your performance, but you also get a score for how well your getup matches the song. So before you dance to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" you might want to consider getting that bright-red jacket first.\n\nThere are five venues for you to bust a groove in, and if you want to bump up the challenge, you can switch to mirror mode, where you'll be performing all the moves with the Wii Remote in your left hand instead of your right. A \"no arrows\" mode will let you play without any arrow indicators to tell you what you need to do. The goal of the game is to mimic the dance moves as closely as possible, so it's more about dancing and less about playing a game.",

What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent’s grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent’s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you’ve won the game. An intriguing backstory makes this an amusing experience for one or two players.",

Rogue’s closest buddies, Helm, Gunnar and Bagman die in their first action, betrayed by a Souther General, during what became known as the Quartz Zone Massacre. Their biochips were installed into Rogue’s Helmet, Rifle and Backpack. They now have control over their respective equipment, providing Rogue with a four-man combat team against the Norts. With Rogue, now the sole survivor of the massacre, his overall objective is simple – find and kill the Traitor General who betrayed the G.I’s! The game fully utilizes the Wiimote interface to provide an immersive gameplay experience with features such as a ‘Twist’ zoom sniper mode. A variety of powerful weapons can be used as well as additional firepower provided by Rogue’s equipment. Gunnar provides weapon modification, Bagman can deploy mines to provide cover, and Helm can create a controllable holographic projection of Rogue to confuse enemies in case of an ambush. The game combines aspects of stealth, cover, and run-n-gun gameplay into 13 action packed single player environments. There is also a fully featured multiplayer mode allowing up to 4 players to compete in a split-screen co-op play.

However, the Ancient Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling levels. \n \nHow to progress through the game: For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long, side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their favorite characters. \n \nCharacters: Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu, Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo universe could appear in this game in one form or another. \n \nSpecial powers/weapons/moves/features: Anything from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however they'd like.

Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is a departure from the more complex attack systems implemented in the Street Fighter series and some previous Vs. fighting titles. The game was built around a simplified three-button attack system (Weak, Medium, Strong) since it was developed with the Wii in mind and an attribute of Vs. games is the ability to execute special moves with simple commands. There is also the multifunctional \"Partner\" button that can be used to tag in a teammate or provide assistance in attacking. The game's two largest and most powerful characters, Tatsunoko's Gold Lightan and Capcom's PTX-40A, fight on their own without a partner resulting in the inability to do universal techniques that require a partner. To regenerate health, each player may switch out their characters at any time. A team can perform two special moves simultaneously at the cost of three special bars. The match is over once one of the teams have no remaining fighters.\n\nTatsunoko vs. Capcom is the first Vs. series game to feature 3D graphics on a 2D plane creating a 2.5D environment consisting of character models and backgrounds rendered in 3D, while gameplay remains on a 2D plane used in traditional fighting games. The camera has freedom to move in 3D at certain times during fights, for dramatic effect. Additionally, most stages have a theme relating to a Tatsunoko franchise or a Capcom game and are mostly not interactive to the player.\n\nUniversal mechanics are similar to the previous Marvel vs. Capcom games. Characters can call their partner to do a predefined \"Variable Assist\" attack. Characters can tag with another character, performing an attack upon entry called a \"Variable Attack\". Performing a \"Variable Counter\" also lets the player tag out with another character. \"Snapback\" is an attack that forces the opponent to switch characters should it land. \"Hyper Variable Combination\" lets characters of one team perform their Hyper moves, attacks that require a stock of level, at the same time, whereas \"Delayed Hyper Cancellation\" cancels a current Hyper move of the character with another Hyper move of the character's partner. Each character has a launcher to send the opponent to the air, allowing the character to do an \"Air Combo\".\n\nThere are also new universal techniques found in the game. \"Variable Aerial Rave\" lets the character switch to his or her partner while in mid-air. \"Mega Crash\" is a defensive maneuver that frees the character from the opponent while sacrificing a part of his or her life and two stocks of levels. \"Baroque Cancel\" is a mode where the character glows in a rainbow of colors while sacrificing the red portion of the character's life - activating the mode cancels the current attack animation, allowing the player to extend combos and deal more damage relative to the amount of red life that is sacrificed. Baroque ends when the character stops or performs a Hyper move.\n\nTatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes has an Arcade mode, which involves the player battling against computer controlled opponents in multiple stages until he or she reaches the boss character, Yami from Ōkami. Time attack and Survival mode requires the player to defeat every character in the game. Survival limits health regeneration while Time attack is solely about completing it in the shortest time possible. There is a shop where unlockable characters, alternate character costumes, character profiles, movies, illustrations, background music for use in the gallery and minigames can be purchased with money obtained throughout the game.",

Rhythm Island is a place of constant surprises, however, and returning at different points during the day, will reveal additional, unique elements.\n\nThe game will feature 120 different tracks that range from “Boom, Boom, Pow” from the The Black Eye Peas, to “La La Land” by Demi Lovato. This new fitness game aims to promote gentle aerobic exercise and players can even keep track of their physical activity as the game constantly monitors the distance you have travelled and the number of steps made. Items that you have picked up will also be tracked.",
